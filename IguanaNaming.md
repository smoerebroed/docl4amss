# Ig\_Naming #

Ig\_naming, the Iguana Naming server is part of the Iguana system.
It provides the ability to register an object under a name
or to look it up by name. It is commonly used to register the
name of a server for others to find.

The ig\_naming process is compiled from open source code (although
a slightly different version).  A complete commented disassembly is
provided at http://code.google.com/p/docl4amss/source/browse/analysis/ig_naming/ig_naming2.idb .
This listing is useful as an example since there is public source
code to match it against and also for pattern matching, since
many Iguana libraries used in other processes and servers are
also linked into ig\_naming.
