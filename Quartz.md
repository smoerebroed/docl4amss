# Quartz Server #

The quartz server is...

Unlike the [Iguana](Iguana.md), [IguanaNaming](IguanaNaming.md) and [Qdms](Qdms.md) servers, the
[Quartz](Quartz.md) server is compiled in thumb mode (with some non-thumb
code).
(XXX it looks like it incorporates some of the same
libraries to talk to iguana, I'm not sure if these
have been rewritten or if they were just recompiled.
At the least it doesn't appear to match the iguana library
code generated with gcc using the "-m thumb" flag).

## Servers ##
The [Quartz](Quartz.md) server starts up threads for several services:
  * KxIpcServer
  * KxMutexServer
  * KxNamingServer
  * KxSmServer
  * KxTimerServer

## Calls ##

These services do not make use of marshallers automatically
generated by magpie from idl4 files. The interface is more
ad hoc.
