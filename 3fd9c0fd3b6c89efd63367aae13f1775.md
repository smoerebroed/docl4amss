# ig\_naming #

The file is generated with the getPrograms.py script
with the two sections of the ELF file that make up
the iguana naming service. It is initially built as
a stand-alone image and then put together with the L4
kernel into a single ELF file.

The extracted file has an MD5 sum of [3fd9c0fd3b6c89efd63367aae13f1775](3fd9c0fd3b6c89efd63367aae13f1775.md)
and a length of 28907 bytes.  The identical image is present
in all known versions of the radio image. The code is compiled
for ARM with no Thumb instructions present.

The ig\_naming image comprises the iguana naming service.
It is a standard part of the iguana system and its full
source is present in the Okl4 release.  This makes it
particularly useful as a "rosetta stone."  By analyzing
this binary against the sources we can find all of the
standard iguana libraries that were linked into ig\_naming
and find the same libraries in other programs.  It
provides a useful way to get used to standard Okl4 and
iguana idioms as they are compiled to assembly. Finally
it lets us determine what portions of iguana are
in the extracted image are different than the closest known
public sources.

## Functionality ##
The ig\_naming service allows other programs to register
names and look them up later.  It provides a convenient
way to find other endpoints by name.
